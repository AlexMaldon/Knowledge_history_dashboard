# Courses History Dashboard

Interactive Streamlit dashboard to explore a career-long history of completed courses and certifications — built to visualize how a learning path evolves over time across platforms, subject areas, and technical skills.

## Why this project

Tracking decades of professional development (courses, certifications, bootcamps) in a spreadsheet makes it hard to see the bigger picture: which platforms were used most, how subject focus shifted over the years, and when specific skills (R, Python, SQL, Cloud/MLOps, Generative AI...) entered the picture. This dashboard turns that flat spreadsheet into an explorable, filterable view.

## Features

- 📈 **Courses per year** — trend of learning activity over time
- 🏛️ **Top platforms** — which platforms (Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Google Cloud, Datacamp, etc.) were used most
- 📚 **Courses by subject area** — distribution across business intelligence, modelling, visualization, production implementation, etc.
- 🛠️ **Skill focus** — total courses tagged per skill (R, Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, IA/ML, Cloud/MLOps...)
- 🕒 **Skill evolution over time** — a stacked area chart showing how skill focus shifted across a career, e.g. moving from classic BI tools toward Python, ML, and Cloud/MLOps in recent years
- 🔍 **Interactive filters** — by year range, subject area, platform, and skill tag

## Tech stack

- Python 3.11
- Streamlit (dashboard UI)
- Pandas (data handling)
- Plotly (visualizations)

## Data structure

Each row in `courses_history.csv` represents one completed course, with:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `idcourse` | Unique identifier |
| `PLATAFORMA` | Platform / provider (Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Google Cloud, etc.) |
| `TITULO` | Course title |
| `AÑO` | Year completed |
| `AREA` | Subject area (Modelling, Visualization, Business intelligence, Production implementation, etc.) |
| `Marketing`, `SPSS`, `EXCEL`, `TABLEAU`, `POWERBI`, `SQL`, `R`, `PYTHON`, `IA ML`, `Cloud MLOps` | Binary skill tags — `1` if the course covered that skill |
